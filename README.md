## STAT4160

This course introduces various topics in experimental design, including simple comparative experiments, single factor analysis of variance, randomized blocks, Latin squares, factorial designs, blocking and confounding, and two-level factorial designs.  This course offers a survey of various experimental design methods. We focus on when to implement these designs and how to analyze the results of such experiments using SAS as the primary programming language for the course.

This repository examines the final project Group 3 completed between Adam Chow and Rhiannon Staley. Out of the two choices of data at our disposal, we decided to choose the engineering data opposed to the golf data. In this repository, you will find both our project presentaion and our final analysis report.
